## Project:
* Application manages ordering of cinema-tickets ("KinoBillett").
* At index the user gets to choose amongst all available films stored in the servers database. 
* Full film title, film-poster and a button to order will be shown for every available film.
* Once "Bestill billetter" (order tickets) is pressed the user will be redirected to the ordering-page ("Bestilling").
* When at the ordering-page the user sees more information about the film they chose at index.html, and will be able to fill out a form in order to order a ticket.
* The form has input validation, and once successfull will store the ticket in its own table in the database.
* All registered tickets will show up on the same page in a html-table. Here the user can edit or delete any of the tickets.
* If the user clicks edit, the registered tickets will be replaced with a row of input-fields with the values they want to change.
* Once the changes are confirmed, the table in the database is updated, and the edited ticket, along with all the others are shown in the html-table again.
* In addition: a delete all tickets button.
